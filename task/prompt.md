Your task is to implement the rust cli tool for agentic development and context management described in task/task.md. You should start by reading the report on agentic development standards using markdown in task/markdown_standards_in_agentic_development-1.md. Our goal here is encompass all current major/popular markdown formats for agentic development standards into our .llmd standard, so that a user who generates an .llmd for their existing codebase which has any of these file formats gets them instantly integrated into their .llmd, ready to be used by agents.

The key goal of llmd is that when an agentic developer has a task, they should be able to combine that task with the catme, and based on that they should be able to structure a request to llmd cli (either using keywords or some other structure) that the llmd cli takes in and responds with a fully organised and composed markdown document including all of the relevant information/documentation/context that the agent needs to begin planning the task properly, and anything they still need to clarify at that point they can clarify with either further manual searches or queries of .llmd or by directly searching the codebase like they usually would.

We also want to use a tool like mdbook to provide a human browsable web version of the .llmd that can be built and/or served locally by running a cli command.

Document your progress working through this task in any way you deem appropriate, but we want to include a simple, minimal, flatfile based issue tracker workflow (in this llmd project, not in llmd itself) which further agents can use to understand your progress and continue your work. The goal should be to be able to ship a complete v1.0.0 CLI by the time you're done as a rust crate.
